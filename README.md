Students tend to miss out the experience of laboratory experiments in online classes and main reason for missing out is ‘Lack of Visualisation’. So Stud-Bud will incorporate 3D models and animations to give students a LIVE feel of laboratory classes. Students will be able to do functions with the models like - open camera place it on a plane, zoom in, zoom out, rotate etc etc with the models.

Students generally tend to stumble over complex mathematical and science questions , many of which google cannot provide answers / steps to solve the problem. Wolf AI is a feature integrated in our application that will give solutions to most of the mathematical and science questions with steps to solve the problem. Just enter the question/equation and find the solution right away.

### LIVE CONNECT
